The benchmark set 'AT' is taken from following the publication.

@inbook{Alvarez:T:89,
	author = "Alvarez-Vald\'{e}s, Ram\'{o}n and Tamarit, Jos\'{e} Manuel",
	chapter = "Heuristic algorithms for resource-constrained project scheduling: A review and an empirical analysis",
	pages = "113--134",
	title = "Advances in Project Scheduling",
	editor = "Slowinski, Roman and Weglarz, Jan",
	publisher = "Elsevier",
	year = "1989"
}

NOTE: The first possible start time is assumed to be 1 for the instances instead
of 0. This only matters when comparing the computed makespans with reported 
makespans in the literature.
