This benchmark set is based on the Lawrence benchmark set 'LA' for Job Shop 
Scheduling. The resource-constrained project scheduling problem were retrieved
by duplicating (triplicating) the jobs and increasing the resource capacity to
2 (3) where the resource requirements of tasks remain unchanged.

The naming of the instances are 'la<no>_x<mult>' where 'no' refers to the
Lawrence's instance number and 'mult' to number of identical jobs. E.g. the
instance 'la01_x3' is constructed from the Lawrence instance 'la01' and by
triplicating the jobs and increasing the resource capacities to 3.

NOTE: Subsets of this set are refers in the literature as follows.
Set A: la01_x[2|3] - la10_x[2|3]
Set B: la11_x[2|3] - la20_x[2|3]
Set C: la21_x[2|3] - la30_x[2|3]
Set D: la31_x[2|3] - la40_x[2|3]
