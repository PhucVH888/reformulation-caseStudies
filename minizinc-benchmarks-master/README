Each problem should be placed in a separate directory.

Each directory should contain model files (.mzn) and data files (.dzn).
The data files may be in subdirectories, but said subdirectories should
NOT be named 'data' (or any case-based variation thereof).  The
runbenchmarks script treats a file named DATA specially, and on
case-insensitive filesystems a subdirectory named 'data' causes a name
clash.

A directory may only contain multiple models if each of the models
are compatible with all of the data files.  Incompatible models and
data files should be separated into different directories.
