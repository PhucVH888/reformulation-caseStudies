Steel Mill Problem. In the Steel Mill Problem [13], we have a set of orders to be fulfilled and the aim is to minimize the amount of wasted steel. Each order i has a size and a color (representing which path it takes in the mill) and is to

be assigned to a slab xi. Each slab can only be used for orders of two different colors. Depending on the sum of the sizes of the orders on each slab, a certain amount of steel will be wasted. We set fâ€² = lex(f, x1, . . . , xn) and try mappings where we take all orders of a certain color from one slab, and all orders of a certain color from another slab, and swap the slabs they are assigned to. We generate 10 random instances of size 40 and 50.

Abstract: Many constraint problems exhibit dominance relations which can be exploited for dramatic reductions in search space. Dominance relations are a generalization of symmetry and conditional symmetry. However, unlike symmetry breaking which is relatively well studied, dominance breaking techniques are not very well understood and are not commonly applied. In this paper, we present formal definitions of dominance breaking, and a generic method for identifying and exploiting dominance relations via dominance breaking constraints. We also give a generic proof of the correctness and compatibility of symmetry breaking constraints, conditional symmetry breaking constraints and dominance breaking constraints.
