RCPSP. The resource constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) [4] schedules n tasks using m renewable resources so that ordering constraints among tasks hold and resource usage limits are respected. A standard domi- nance rule for this problem, used in search, is that each task must start at time 0 or when another task ends, since any schedule not following this rule is do- mainated by one constructed by shifting tasks earlier until the rule holds. We use the instances from the standard J60 benchmark set [1] which are non-trivial (not solved by root propagation) and solvable by at least one of the methods.

Abstract: Many constraint problems exhibit dominance relations which can be exploited for dramatic reductions in search space. Dominance relations are a generalization of symmetry and conditional symmetry. However, unlike symmetry breaking which is relatively well studied, dominance breaking techniques are not very well understood and are not commonly applied. In this paper, we present formal definitions of dominance breaking, and a generic method for identifying and exploiting dominance relations via dominance breaking constraints. We also give a generic proof of the correctness and compatibility of symmetry breaking constraints, conditional symmetry breaking constraints and dominance breaking constraints.
