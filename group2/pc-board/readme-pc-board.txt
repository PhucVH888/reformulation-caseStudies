PC Board Problem. In the PC Board Problem [19], we have n × m compo- nents of various types which need to be assigned to m machines. Each machine must be assigned exactly n components and there are restrictions on the sets of components that can go on the same machine. Each type of component gains a certain utility depending on which machine it is assigned to and the goal is to maximize the overall utility. We set f′ = lex(f, x1,1, x1,2, . . . , xn,m) where xi,j is the type of component assigned to the jth spot on the ith machine. We consider mappings which swap two components on different machines. We generate 20 random instances of size 6 × 8.

Abstract: Many constraint problems exhibit dominance relations which can be exploited for dramatic reductions in search space. Dominance relations are a generalization of symmetry and conditional symmetry. However, unlike symmetry breaking which is relatively well studied, dominance breaking techniques are not very well understood and are not commonly applied. In this paper, we present formal definitions of dominance breaking, and a generic method for identifying and exploiting dominance relations via dominance breaking constraints. We also give a generic proof of the correctness and compatibility of symmetry breaking constraints, conditional symmetry breaking constraints and dominance breaking constraints.
